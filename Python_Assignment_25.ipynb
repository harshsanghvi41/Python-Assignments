    "\n",
    "Ans: If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Yield is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement."

    "5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)."
